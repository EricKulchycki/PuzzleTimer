Basic Timer Implementation

Basic Timer code
Start/stop button(s)
Timer start/stop on screen touch
Reset Button (to set current time to 0:00)
Save Button


Lap/Split Implementation

Split button (records elapsed time between Split Button presses)
Show list of previous splits
Implement dynamic data storage of splits (Linked List of times)
Split reset button
Split comparisons
	show time difference between ith split of current run vs ith split of past run(s)


Delays

Pre-timer delay
Post-timer delay
Between-split delay
Menu for user input to (de)select delays
Allow to select delay length and usage


Data Storage

Create a “Time” class as main unit of measurement
	Used to hold both split and “full” run times 
	(needs another name, Time is already a [depreciated] Java class)
	difference between times is stored as a long (counts milliseconds)
Create Split Class
	Linked list of nodes with “Time” objects
	Create nodes as split button inputs are made
Create a new Split class on startup and Reset Button input
Create form of storage for Time and Split classes
	for prototype, create linked lists
 		Linked list updated with Save Button input
	for finished version, transfer from linked lists to persistent storage
		Savefile? Database?
